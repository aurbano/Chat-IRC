# Chat-IRC

Java chat almost IRC compliant with graphical interface. The GUI was written using Java Swing mainly, although the main chat area was styled using HTML+CSS for extra control.


## Running
First launch the server: ChatServer.jar:

```java
java -jar ChatServer.jar [port]
```

Once it's running execute the client (ClienteChat), you will have to build it first. Write the server IP and port where the server is running, and that should be it.

## Extras
Since this was a University project, we were all creating our own different clients. For a bit of extra fun I wrote [a DDOS tool](https://github.com/aurbano/Chatter) that could take down any chat server within seconds :)
